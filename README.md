planning, and technical collaboration. This experience has influenced our focus
on clarity, inclusivity, and accessibility while designing MarketMind AI.

Despite communication challenges, the team collaborated effectively through
visual workflows, structured documentation, and sign-language-based discussions.
The team is fully prepared to explain and demonstrate the project through written
or visual communication during evaluations.
